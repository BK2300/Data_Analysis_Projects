Today was a really productive day. Ive managed to follow my set rules of only different 10 sodacan models from each store.
Ive think i managed to go to, 4 different stores.

The most interesting observation ive made, was in a store called "Normal".
Not only did i find out, that most of their energidrink cans are imported from Hungary, but a few from Denmark(sadly weren't able to figure out why)
But I also found a Monster, Bad Apple can that looked extremely cursed!
    - Not sure what happen to it, but my assumption is that the red dye from the machine malfunctioned. But it was awesome.
       And the women looks extra bloody!
