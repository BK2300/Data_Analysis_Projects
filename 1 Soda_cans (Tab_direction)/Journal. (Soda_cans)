Today was a really productive day. Ive managed to follow my set rules of only different 10 sodacan models from each store.
Ive think i managed to go to, 4 different stores.

The most interesting observation ive made, was in a store called "Normal".
Not only did i find out, that most of their energidrink cans are imported from Hungary, but a few from Denmark(sadly weren't able to figure out why)
But I also found a Monster, Bad Apple can that looked extremely cursed!
    - Not sure what happen to it, but my assumption is that the red dye from the machine malfunctioned. But it was awesome.
       And the women looks extra bloody!

This week we learned recursion and modular etc.
This gave we an inspiration and maybe a good idea:
    My code is getting messy and maybe to much to look at. Couldnt I create more classes for "cleaning, summary, vizualisation"?
    I tought it was inheretance. But my teacher meant its modularsation and functions. Modularisation was new concept for me and still in progress to learn it.
    But using functions was a smart plan, I Instantly saw the point/vision of that.

Hopefully its can help me with making my code more readable and cleaner to look at.
