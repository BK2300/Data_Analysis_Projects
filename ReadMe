This repository is for Data analysis projects only.

The projects are going to a mixture of Python and R. But Ill do most of my programming in Python, since Ill like to practice that a bit more.
& I believe masterings Python is a way more demanded skill then R. But R has cool features too.

FunFacts: Based on my researches python is better and easier for newbies.
          At an intermediant level, R is better for statistics and machine learning.

Its going to be a mixture of projects ive made myself from the scrap & can really curious about to figure out
    (Such as the my first project with the SodaCans - TabAngle).

But if I find some extra ordinarily interesting from my lectures. Ill probably work more on then & Include them.






Changes:
If I had the chance to change something. I would have done my data collection a bit more different.
I took alot of different can brands. But their models were "original". So my result would show me "model, original" have like about 35% more then "brand, x-name"
It makes sense. But a computer thinks they're the same. So for the next time i could have called
    the "c.original" for Cola & "m.original" for monster. So they would differentiate from each other.
