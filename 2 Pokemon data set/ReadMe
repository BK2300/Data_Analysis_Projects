Project status: Done

This was my first every data analysis project by myself from scratch.
With a minimal assistance of AI.

* About dataset
This is a dataset of the first 151 pokemon, from the first season.
Thought it just look funny to revisit and experiment with, now that i've learned something new stuff.
The dataset did not have any data cleaning necessarily needed

* Methodology
Ive started out importing the dataset and doing some Exploratory analysis.
I wanted the to know all the column names and which ones was categorical and numerical.
I did some statistics of the numerical (Weight and Height) and made some assumptions based on the numbers i could see.

* Visualization
Most of the time. If i work with some numerical datasets, do i start out with a correlation plot. Since it helps me get inspired what to look for.
Then after i made some histograms to see the distribution of pokemons primary type.
Then some histogram of Weight class and Height, which confirmed my suspicion of outlier.
And another correlation heatmap of which pokemon Type1 and type2, had the biggest procentage correlation.

* Business decision
If I had this dataset and should make a decision based on the dataset. Would i say:
- Since the primary pokemon type are Water, Fire and Grass. They should focus a bit less on water types. Since they constitutes 18,54% of all the primary pokemon types
- Ice and Dragon could be more focused on. They have their own niche constitues of only 1,32% each of all the pokemons
- they could play around with some more primary and secondary types abit more. Like a chilitable, mixing and matching.
